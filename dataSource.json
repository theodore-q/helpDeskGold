We have mastered one thing really well: *workflows*.\nNow, do you have a workflow problem or a task management problem or both?! Tough, right!? That’s exactly why I am writing to you. Within 5 minutes I can assess if KiSSFLOW is best fit for the problem you have, saving you lots of time on evaluation. I value time and wish neither of us waste it.\n\nI will call you in the next 30 minutes or do you want to do this over email?\n\nCheers,\nBen",

We're excited to have you as a member and can't wait to see what you pin.\n\nA few tips to get the most out of Pinterest:\n\n- Install the bookmarklet. It lets you add a pin from any website with just one click.\n\n- Follow a few more pinboards. After all, Pinterest is as much about discovering new things as it is about sharing.\n\n- Pin carefully! As one of the first members of Pinterest, your pins will help set the tone for the whole community. Use big images, write thoughtful descriptions, and pin things you really love. Also, no nudity :)\n\nThanks for joining and happy pinning!\nBen and the Pinterest Team",

Why did you sign up for Rabbut?\n\nI ask because:\n1.) I want to build the best tool that you can possibly get\n2.) I can’t read your mind\n3.) Who doesn’t want more action?

    "desc": "I got the wrong sort of birthday present yesterday: a sincerely-written post by Jason Kincaid lamenting a perceived decline in the quality of Evernote software over the past few months. I could quibble with the specifics, but reading Jason’s article was a painful and frustrating experience because, in the big picture, he’s right. We’re going to fix this.\n\nThe past couple of years have been an amazing time for Evernote. We’ve grown massively as a company, a community and a product. And we’re still growing quickly. However, there comes a time in a booming startup’s life when it’s important to pause for a bit and look in rather than up. When it’s more important to improve existing features than to add new ones. More important to make our existing users happier than to just add more new users. More important to focus on our direction than on our speed. This is just common sense, but startups breathe growth and intentionally slowing down to focus on details and quality doesn’t come naturally to many of us. Despite this, the best product companies in the world have figured out how to make constant quality improvements part of their essential DNA. Apple and Google and Amazon and Facebook and Twitter and Tesla know how to do this. So will we. This is our central theme for 2014: constant improvement of the core promise of Evernote.\n\nThis isn’t something we just decided yesterday. We kicked off a company-wide effort to improve quality a couple of months ago. The precipitating factor was the frustrating roll-out of our iOS 7 version. We gained many new users, but rushing to completely rebuild the app for the new platform resulted in stability problems that disproportionally hit longer-term customers, including ourselves. Since all Evernote employees are power users by definition, no one is more motivated to make Evernote better just for the sake of our own productivity and sanity. I’ve never seen people happier to just fix bugs.\n\nQuality improvements are the sort of thing that you ought to show, not just talk about, so we hadn’t planned on discussing this theme until closer to the end of 2014. However, Jason’s article hit too close to home to leave unremarked, so I decided to be up front about what we’ve done in the past few months and what we’re going to do in the next few.\n\nStaffing\n\nToday, there are 164 engineers and designers working at Evernote. About 150 of them are currently assigned to our core software products. The total number will increase quite a bit in 2014, but the proportion will stay the same: over 90% of our resources will go towards improving our core experiences.\n\nPast Two Months: Stability\n\nStarting last November, our first priority was to drastically improve the stability and performance of our main apps, especially for long-term users with many notes. We’ve made significant progress, and Evernote is measurably less buggy than it was two months ago.\n\nWe’re starting to see the initial results of this effort in our app store ratings. For instance, when we started this effort in November, Evernote for iOS 7 was at a frustratingly low 2 stars. Today, it’s at 4.5. Our customer support volumes for iOS have been cut by more than half: from an average of 366 per day in November, to 148 now. We’ve made similar improvements to many of the other apps as well. I’m proud of the progress we’ve made in this area, but just because an app has a good rating, doesn’t mean that our work is finished; there are countless improvements to stability and performance that we’ll continue to make.\n\nThese are recent improvements, but the perception of stability is a lagging indicator of actual stability; you judge how solid or buggy an app feels based on your past few months of experience with it. So even though Evernote is a lot better already, and will get much better still, it’ll take longer for this feeling to really sink in. We understand that we have to maintain a high level of quality for the long term, if we want Evernote to be seen as a truly high-quality product.\n\nNear Future: Design and Simplicity\n\nAs we get nearer to achieving our stability and performance goals, we’ve turned our attention to the other important component of quality: great design. Over the next few months, we’ll be releasing new versions of all the apps that incorporate our many lessons learned about what does and doesn’t work. All of our apps will be getting significant improvements and simplifications to the user experience starting in the next few weeks. The five most important areas of improvement that we’re targeting on all platforms are note editing, navigation, search, sync and collaboration.\n\nOur new philosophy is to find every spot in our products where we’ve been forced to make a trade-off between doing what’s simple and doing what’s powerful, then rethink it so that the simplest approach is also the most powerful. We know we’ve found a good design for something when that conflict disappears. It feels like magic when that happens, and we’ll have several bits of magic in the coming months.\n\nI turned 42 yesterday, which is the year that, according to classics of western literature, life, the universe and everything will start to make sense. This isn’t the way I imagined it starting, but I’m glad to have the chance to tell you what we started a few months ago, and what we’re going to be focusing on in 2014.\n\nThanks to Jason and to the millions of Evernote users who depend on us every day and who go through the effort of fighting for a better Evernote. Our goal isn’t to have a product that’s just good enough that users rely on it despite its warts, it’s to have a world class product, built with solid technology and with a fit and finish worthy of our users’ love and loyalty.\n\nWe’re the biggest Evernote users around, and it’s important to be in love with what you build.\n\nIt’s going to be a great year.\n\n- Phil Libin, CEO",

    "desc": "Hello -\n\nI'm emailing to update you on our service outages on Monday and Tuesday this week.\n\nService was fully restored at about 11:00am PST Tuesday and all systems are still stable as of this morning.\n\nI know this has been a very frustrating and trying time for you as an Olark customer, and for that I apologize. Please know that, since Monday, our team has been working through the night to resolve two different incidents. (The post mortems on these incidents are here and here.)\n\nThis has been a tough two days knowing that we've let you down, and we want to make amends.\n\nWe failed to provide you with the service you deserve. I wish I could tell you this outage was unpredictable, or it was all an external party's fault, but it wasn't.  \n\nOn Monday night, our upstream service provider experienced an unexpected outage caused by maintenance of its entire data center, which lasted for hours. By 9:06pm PST, the Olark team identified the network outage. At 10:44pm PST, the service provider acknowledged its routine maintenance had problems and was affecting its customers, including Olark. Once the issue was resolved on their end, we began to restart our servers at around midnight.\n\nWe have been aware that it was possible that a cascading reboot of Olark’s system could lead to an outage. This is the kind of exceptionally rare event that could only happen during a major data center disruption like the one on Monday night. We have in fact been working on hardening our system to this kind of risk for months.\n\nThat’s why we know it was preventable. In the end, we did not execute quickly enough to prevent these two issues from affecting you.\n\nWe feel no great irony in the fact the specific component that lead to this outage was scheduled to be replaced this week. The positive news is that we spent the last months rewriting how the particular servers affected today are set up. Had the servers been using this new set up, it would have helped avoid this issue. These updates are still due to be released imminently as they were scheduled to do so regardless of this particular outage.\n\nYou can rest assured, we are taking this seriously.\n\nI realize that doesn't make up for lost business Monday and Tuesday though.\n\nAs a mea culpa, we are issuing you 2 days worth of credit on your account. You should see that reflected in the next few days.\n\nIf you feel this isn't sufficient, please let me know and we can discuss further - benc@olark.com\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can do to help,\n\nBen Congleton,\nChief Executive Olarker, Olark\n\nPS: You can subscribe to up to the minute service status updates at http://status.olark.com",

    "desc": "It’s been a few years since f.lux for Windows got an update, but this new version is finally out of beta. We have a ton of new features and bugfixes to tell you about, and we hope you enjoy trying them out in the new version.\n\nBig new cool stuff\n\n- f.lux can go warmer than 3400K now, down to 2700K. Or even 1200K if you really want it to.\n- Support for color profiles from a hardware calibrator\n- Movie mode. This setting warms up your display, but it preserves shadow detail, skintones, and sky colors better than f.lux’s typical colors. It lasts 2½ hours, which lets you watch most feature films\n- Disable until morning, for late-night crunch mode\n- A new “darkroom” mode, which inverts colors and gets very red\n- A map to help you find your location\n- Hotkeys to dim your display (Alt-PgDn, Alt-PgUp) late at night, so desktop users can dim too\n- A hotkey to disable/enable f.lux quickly: Alt-End\n- If you have a laptop, f.lux gets warmer when your backlight dims, like an incandescent lamp\n- A simple schedule for Philips Hue, so you can f.lux your house\n\nSome more fixes\n\n- Safe mode for playing video games without hiccups\n- Bugs fixed with Intel chipsets\n- Smoother animations and fading\n- Better support for Windows 7 & 8\n- Thanks for using f.lux, and if you need help with the new features, please join us on our support page here: http://justgetflux.com/faq.html.\n\n—Michael and Lorna",

    "desc": "Hi there, \n\nThree years ago, the Cameo team set off with a big mission: to make filmmaking more accessible and fun. We were amazed at the response from our community, and continue to be inspired by the films you create. We also heard a lot of great feedback and ideas directly from people like you.\n\nWith this feedback, we spent over a year at Vimeo designing and building a brand-new app. The new Cameo app has tons of great features, like full HD editing and rendering, completely customizable themes, and more refined editing controls (just to name a few).\n\nAs we focus our attention on the new app, we will be shutting down version 1.0 of Cameo. The original version of Cameo will no longer function after Thursday, October 1. \n\nYou can continue to edit your current project, just make sure to finish and save it by October 1. You can save all your existing videos to your Camera Roll via the app, or you can use this easy web tool to transfer all your videos at once: Save your Cameo videos\n\nIf you haven’t checked out the new app, we highly recommend downloading it for free: Download the brand-new Cameo\n\nShould you have any questions or need help, please let us know.\n\nThanks for all your support and feedback over the past year and a half! We’re excited to be entering this next phase of an even- more-awesome Cameo.\n\n\nAndy Thompson\nCo-founder, Cameo \n\nTL;DR We’re focusing on the all-new, all-awesome Cameo 2.0 app. The original Cameo app will no longer function after Thursday October 1.

    "desc": "Hey, we're changing our Terms of Service. \n\nIt has been two years since HipChat joined the Atlassian family, and we're bigger and better because of it. Of course, when a product grows this quickly, there are always lots of big changes going on. We need to rewrite certain bits of code to make them faster, change the way our servers run to make them more reliable, improve the way our team is organized so we can keep it productive, and implement new ways to support our users.\n\nToday, we're announcing a change that many of you have asked us for: bringing HipChat under the same terms as other Atlassian products (currently the Atlassian Customer Agreement and the Atlassian Privacy Policy – together referred to as the \"Atlassian terms\"). No, seriously, we get asked about this a lot.\n\nUnfortunately, we didn't think through the original HipChat terms as much as we should have, and they have caused considerable pain for many users over the years. (Note to other startups: get someone to look over your terms because they're tough to change!) Anyway, we know this stuff can be boring, but it's important, so we hope you'll take the time to read them.\n\nHere's an overview of the major differences between the HipChat terms and privacy policy and the Atlassian terms that will replace them:\n\n- The Atlassian terms are better for your company. The Atlassian terms have the structure and provisions that many businesses expect, which larger companies may appreciate. These include more specific termination provisions (rather than the right to terminate in our sole discretion), as well more favorable liability limitations for paying customers. Atlassian's liability for paid accounts is now capped at amounts we've received from you in the last 12 months, rather than $100. In addition, the Atlassian terms include liability caps and disclaimers for customers, rather than being only in Atlassian's favor. - To accommodate our increased liability to paying customers, our liability for free products is being reduced to $20.\n- The Atlassian terms require binding arbitration for disputes. As HipChat grows, we need to have a cost-effective alternative to going to court. Our terms now mandate that we resolve disputes via arbitration. We expect binding arbitration to help contain legal costs and offer a faster path to resolution for both parties.\n- The Atlassian terms include a more comprehensive privacy policy. The Atlassian Privacy Policy covers the information we collect and how we use that information in much more detail. For example, it includes an explicit discussion of how we collect analytics information to improve our products and services. This analytics information could include elements of user content related to the function being performed.\n- The Atlassian terms allow companies to access 1-to-1 chat history (for future chats, not retroactively). The Atlassian Privacy Policy also removes a HipChat restriction that has caused a lot of confusion for business customers. Under HipChat's support documentation (which is referenced in the HipChat privacy policy), HipChat administrators cannot view other users' 1-to-1 chat history or the files that were shared. In many cases, this is inconsistent with an employer's policy about employee communications occurring in the workplace, which employers typically have the right to access. Under the Atlassian Privacy Policy, HipChat administrators will have the right to access all information in the HipChat accounts they manage, including 1-to-1 chat history and files shared in those 1-to-1 chats. The HipChat Specific Terms require customers (e.g. the account holder) to secure all required consents from users to allow for this level of access. Note that this change does not apply retroactively; 1-to-1 chats occurring before the Atlassian terms become effective are still covered by the prior HipChat policies.\n- The Atlassian terms will be effective starting May 27, 2014 for free accounts and new purchases. For existing paid subscriptions, the new agreement will take effect on your first renewal after this date. If your subscription is set to auto-renew and you are not willing to accept the Atlassian terms, please make sure to cancel prior to your next renewal.\n\nAdopting the Atlassian terms will bring HipChat in line with the other Atlassian products you might be using and will help us stay focused on building a great product for you. If you have any questions you can direct them to customer-agreement@hipchat.com.\n\nCheers,\nThe HipChat Founders",

With an average time to hire of four days and only a 15% hourly mark-up for 1099 candidates (30% for W2), several employers have had success in quickly augmenting their teams with Hired's Freelancers.\n \nLet me know if you have any questions or if there is anything else that I can help with!\n \nBest,\nMary Catherine",

    "desc": "At Etsy, we're always striving to make our policies clearer and our services easier to use. Today, we're announcing some changes to Etsy's terms and policies to do just that. We've shared the highlights below. You can review the full policies here.\n\nIntroducing Our House Rules\n\nFirst, we've built a brand new section on Etsy that will make it easier for you to find the information from our legal terms and policies that's relevant for you. We're calling it Our House Rules because it covers all of your rights and responsibilities when you use our services and participate in the Etsy community.\n\nClearer language – in more languages\n\nWe've renamed, reorganized and even rewritten most of our policies to make them clearer and easier to understand. For example, we've renamed our Seller Guidelines to be called our Seller Policy, which we've expanded to give you more detailed guidance (but please note: even though the policy looks different, we didn't make any material changes to it). We've also translated our policies, including our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, into French, German, Dutch, Spanish and Italian.\n\nLegal changes\n\nThe terms and policies in Our House Rules make up a legally-binding agreement between you and Etsy that spells out each party's rights and obligations when it comes to your use of our services. Here are the main changes to our previous agreement:\n\n•\tYour contract with Etsy: Users living in North or South America will continue to contract with Etsy, Inc., but Etsy users living elsewhere are now contracting with Etsy Ireland, a subsidiary of Etsy, Inc. You won't notice any difference in our services. We made this change to reflect the international nature of our business.\n\n•\tCharges: We've consolidated all of our terms related to seller fees and bills into a single Fees & Payments Policy. That policy also includes a link to our Direct Checkout Policy, which clarifies Etsy's role in processing payments.\n\n•\tMember information: We take our responsibility to protect member information very seriously. Our new Requests for Information Policy details how we respond to any requests for member information.\n\n•\tUser content: We've clarified how we handle content that users post to Etsy's site or apps. We now refer to it as “your content” in our Terms of Use, to make it crystal clear that we treat anything you post (photos, descriptions, names, etc.) as your property. Posting your content grants Etsy a (non-exclusive) license to use your content, and we've listed the ways that we can do that.\n\n•\tDispute resolution: We hope it never comes to this, but if you find yourself in a dispute with Etsy, the updated dispute resolution section in the Terms of Use explains how and where you can bring a claim against us.\n\n•\tContact preferences: We've updated our Privacy Policy to clarify that we may occasionally add new channels to share news or information with our users, but that we'll always make sure you can easily choose exactly what types of messages you want to receive (or don't want to receive).\n\nYou don't need to take any further action to accept the updated Terms of Use, Privacy Policy or other policies. The changes will go into effect for you on August 29, 2015. By continuing to use our services after that time, you agree to the updated terms.\n\nThanks for being a part of the Etsy community. Feel free to contact legal@etsy.com if you have any questions. And remember, our house is your house!\n\nRead Our House Rules (button)",

They’ve all said bye-bye to manual reports and embraced the ease of real-time access to their most important metrics.\n\nWithout further ado and in no particular order, here they are: \n\n- Google Analytics - See how visitors interact with your website.\n- Google Sheets - Pull all your custom data into your dashboard.\n- Twitter - Never miss a conversation.\n- Facebook - Track your social campaigns in real time.\n- MailChimp - Keep a close eye on your email efforts.\n- Pingdom - Monitor uptime and downtime in one place.\n- New Relic - Get immediate insight to your end user’s behaviour.\n- Mixpanel - See your users’ behaviour instantly.\n- Salesforce - Know how healthy your sales funnel is at all times.\n\n\nReady to try them out? \n\nLog in and browse integrations\n\n\nCheers,\nTamsen, Hariharan, Jason, Javier and Luis\nThe Customer Success team",
